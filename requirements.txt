# AI Study Companion Pro - Requirements
# Production-ready dependencies

# === CORE REQUIREMENTS (Minimal Install) ===
# These are REQUIRED for the app to run
streamlit
pandas

# === FULL FEATURES (Recommended) ===
# Install these for all features

# AI/ML Libraries
transformers
torch
nltk
scikit-learn

# Document Processing
python-pptx
pdfplumber
PyPDF2
python-docx

# Visualization & Data
plotly
openpyxl

# === OPTIONAL (Nice to Have) ===
# These improve functionality but aren't required

# OCR for scanned PDFs (optional)
# pytesseract==0.3.10

# Database (if persistent storage needed)
# tinydb==4.8.0

# === NOTES ===
# Minimal install (works 90% of features):
#   pip install streamlit pandas
#
# Full install (all features):
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
#
# The app works with just streamlit + pandas!
# Other libraries enable additional features:
#   - transformers: Abstractive summarization
#   - python-pptx: PowerPoint generation  
#   - pdfplumber/PyPDF2: PDF text extraction
#   - python-docx: DOCX text extraction
#   - nltk: Better text processing
#   - scikit-learn: TF-IDF topic extraction
#
# Without these libraries, the app uses:
#   - Extractive summarization (deterministic)
#   - Text-based slide export
#   - TXT file uploads only
#   - Frequency-based topic extraction
